# The-Effect-of-Force-Field-Detuning-on-Bimanual-Coordination

Data Analysis conducted for a KINARM study looking at the effect of bimanual coordination and varying force feild environemnts (i.e., elastic forcefield and viscous forcefield). Subjects were tasked with perfroming a bimanual coordination movemement in either the in-phase (both hands moving in the same direction) or the anti-phase (both hands moving in the opposite direction). The elastic and viscous forces were applied to their limbs as they were moving and relative phase was measured from the KINARM data collected. The data was downsampled from 4000Hz to 1000Hz.


Code Information: All the MATLAB files were used to extract the KINARM data and all teh R files were used to visualize and analyze that data.
